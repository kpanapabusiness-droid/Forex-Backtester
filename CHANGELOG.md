# Changelog

## v1.9.9-hardstop
- New Golden Standard: Hard-Stop Realism
  - Intrabar touch of TP/BE/TS exits immediately.
  - Trailing Stop activates & updates on closes only (monotone), exits intrabar when touched.
  - Pre-TP1 C1 reversal scratch â‰ˆ 0 PnL (tolerance allows spread).
- Invariants preserved: audit fields immutable; spreads change PnL only, not trade counts.
